# Hello friend

I build stuff on Ethereum and I occasionally publish little tools that I think
might prove useful to other people. This is not my main account. I'm not
particularly hiding but I like to separate concerns. This is the side of me that
is dedicated to Ethereum and the EVM in general. My identity is just not
relevant.

I read DMs on Twitter: [@0xSynon](https://twitter.com/0xSynon)
